<current_state>
v1.2 UX Consolidation milestone is fully shipped (all 12 phases done). Session ended after two post-ship cleanup fixes triggered by a user question about Assessment Analytics still appearing in CMP. All changes committed and clean.
</current_state>

<completed_work>

- Removed "Assessment Analytics" card from `Views/CMP/Index.cshtml` (it was a Phase 12-03 leftover — had been updated to link to CDP/Dashboard but never removed from the CMP hub page)
- Quick-003: Deleted orphaned `ReportsDashboardViewModel` class from `Models/ReportsDashboardViewModel.cs` (zero usages — supporting classes were moved to CDPDashboardViewModel.cs in Phase 12-01 but the original class was never deleted)
- Quick-003: Cleaned stale comment in `Models/CDPDashboardViewModel.cs` ("will be deleted in Plan 12-03" was outdated)

**Commits this session:**
- `e9e38ae` — Remove Assessment Analytics card from CMP Index
- `c22efc2` — Delete orphaned ReportsDashboardViewModel + clean stale comments
- `8e364df` / `600b6c2` — Quick-003 docs
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

- No planned work remaining for v1.2
- Next logical step: `/gsd:new-milestone` to define v1.3 (or audit/archive v1.2 first with `/gsd:audit-milestone`)
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- Assessment Analytics access point now lives **exclusively** in CDP > Dashboard (Analytics tab, HC/Admin gated)
- CMP module has no Analytics entry point — clean separation of concerns
- `UserAssessmentHistoryViewModel` preserved in `Models/ReportsDashboardViewModel.cs` file (still active in CMPController + UserAssessmentHistory view)
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
None.
</blockers>

<context>
User asked why Assessment Analytics was still visible in CMP after Phase 12 supposedly removed it. Investigation revealed the CMP/Index card had been updated to link to CDP/Dashboard but the card itself was never deleted. A quick audit also surfaced the orphaned ViewModel class. Both fixed, committed, and clean. No blockers heading into the next milestone.

<next_action>
Start with: `/gsd:resume-work` — will show v1.2 complete + offer milestone audit or new milestone options.
</next_action>
