<current_state>
All 4 parallel researchers for v2.1 milestone have completed. Research files are in `.planning/research/`.
Next step: spawn synthesizer agent to create v2.1 SUMMARY.md, then define REQUIREMENTS.md, then spawn roadmapper for phases 41+.
No active execution phase. Still in new-milestone workflow (between research and requirements).
</current_state>

<completed_work>

- Research (System Audit): SYSTEM-AUDIT.md — 4 P0 issues, 12 P1, 8 P2 found in existing exam system
- Research (Stack): STACK.md — EF Core upsert patterns, polling, ElapsedSeconds field, caching
- Research (Features): EXAM-RESILIENCE-FEATURES.md, EXAM-RESILIENCE-QA.md, EXAM-RESILIENCE-SUMMARY.md, EXAM-RESILIENCE-INDEX.md — UX patterns for auto-save, resume, invalidation, HC monitoring
- Research (Pitfalls): PITFALLS-AUTO-SAVE-RESUME-POLLING.md, SUMMARY-AUTO-SAVE-RESUME-POLLING.md, README-AUTO-SAVE-RESUME-POLLING.md — 10 critical pitfalls, race conditions, TempData issue, polling storm prevention
- Milestones v1.9 and v2.0 archived (complete-milestone done), git tags v1.9 and v2.0 created
- Phase 40 (History Tab) executed and verified
- Phase 36 (Delete Guards) confirmed complete, roadmap synced
- Phase 37 (Drag-Drop Reorder) marked cancelled — feature intentionally removed by prior decision

</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

- **Synthesis**: Spawn gsd-research-synthesizer to read all 4 research outputs and create `.planning/research/SUMMARY.md` (overwriting the old v1.2 one)
- **Requirements**: Define REQUIREMENTS.md for v2.1 — requirements expected: SAVE-01 (auto-save per click+interval), SAVE-02 (visual feedback toast+badge), RESUME-01 (session resume with elapsed time), POLL-01 (worker exam status polling + close-early redirect), MON-01 (HC live progress monitoring), AUDIT-01 (system audit fixes for P0 issues)
- **Roadmap**: Spawn roadmapper to add phases 41-45 to ROADMAP.md — phase order from pitfalls researcher: 41 SaveAnswer → 42 Session Resume → 43 Worker Polling → 44 Close Early Concurrency → 45 HC Live Monitoring
- **STATE.md update**: Update with roadmap progress after requirements + roadmap created
- **Commit**: Commit research + requirements + roadmap under new milestone

</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- v2.1 milestone name: "Assessment Resilience & Real-Time Monitoring"
- Auto-save timing: both per-click AND per-interval (60s default)
- Worker notification on Close Early: browser auto-redirect to results (soft modal first, then redirect)
- HC monitoring refresh: live every 5-10 seconds
- NIP column: removed entirely from MonitoringDetail page
- System analysis scope: comprehensive (P0 + P1 issues from audit)
- Phase order is strictly sequential (41→42→43→44→45) — not parallelizable due to DB schema deps

</decisions_made>

<blockers>

- Old `.planning/research/SUMMARY.md` contains v1.2 content — synthesizer must overwrite it with v2.1 content
- No REQUIREMENTS.md exists (deleted after v2.0 archive) — must be created fresh for v2.1

</blockers>

<context>
In /gsd:new-milestone workflow. All 4 researchers completed mid-session and user called /gsd:pause-work before synthesis could run.
Milestone scope is clear: make exam system resilient (auto-save, resume, close-early detect) + give HC live visibility (progress columns, NIP removed).
The 5-phase structure from pitfalls researcher (41-45) aligns well with the features/stack research.
</context>

<next_action>
Run /gsd:resume-work which will detect this file. Then spawn synthesizer:

Task(
  prompt="Synthesize research outputs for v2.1 milestone into SUMMARY.md. Read ALL of these files: .planning/research/SYSTEM-AUDIT.md, .planning/research/STACK.md, .planning/research/EXAM-RESILIENCE-FEATURES.md, .planning/research/EXAM-RESILIENCE-QA.md, .planning/research/PITFALLS-AUTO-SAVE-RESUME-POLLING.md. Write synthesized output to: .planning/research/SUMMARY.md (overwrite existing v1.2 content). Focus on: v2.1 features (auto-save, resume, worker polling, HC monitoring), recommended phase order (41-45), critical pitfalls to avoid, tech stack patterns to use.",
  subagent_type="gsd-research-synthesizer"
)

After SUMMARY.md is written, proceed to define REQUIREMENTS.md and then spawn roadmapper.
