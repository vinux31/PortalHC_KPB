### Phase 4: Foundation & Coaching Sessions
**Goal:** Coaches can log sessions and action items against a stable data model, with users able to view their full coaching history
**Depends on:** Phase 3 (v1.0 complete)
**Requirements:** COACH-01, COACH-02, COACH-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Coach can create a coaching session with domain-specific fields (Kompetensi, SubKompetensi, Deliverable, CoacheeCompetencies, CatatanCoach, Kesimpulan, Result) for a coachee
  2. Coach can add action items with due dates to a coaching session
  3. User can view their coaching session history with date and status filtering
  4. All existing v1.0 features remain functional after schema migration (broken CoachingLog FK fixed)
**Plans:** 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 04-01-PLAN.md — Data foundation: models, DbContext, CoachingLog cleanup, migration
- [x] 04-02-PLAN.md — Controller actions and view: coaching CRUD with filtering

#### Phase 5: Proton Deliverable Tracking
**Goal:** Coachee can track assigned deliverables in a structured Kompetensi hierarchy, with coaches able to upload and revise evidence files sequentially
**Depends on:** Phase 4
**Requirements:** PROTN-01, PROTN-02, PROTN-03, PROTN-04, PROTN-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  2. Coachee can view their full deliverable list on the IDP Plan page organized by Kompetensi > Sub Kompetensi > Deliverable (read-only, no status, no navigation links)
  3. Coachee can only access the next deliverable after the current one is approved — sequential lock is enforced
  4. Coach can upload evidence files for an active deliverable on the Deliverable page
  5. Coach can revise evidence and resubmit a rejected deliverable
**Plans:** 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 05-01-PLAN.md — Data foundation: Proton models, DbContext, migration, seed data

**Requirements:** CONS-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Admin/HC can access Assessment Management from Kelola Data hub page (Section B card)
  2. All assessment admin functions work from Admin section (create/edit/delete assessment, manage questions, manage packages, monitoring, export, audit log)
  3. CMP/Assessment personal view (worker taking exams, viewing results) remains accessible and unchanged
  4. Old /CMP/Assessment?view=manage URL redirects to new location
**Plans:** TBD

### ~~Phase 62: Update Kelola Data Hub~~ — Partially superseded by v2.5 Phase 70
**Status:** Partially superseded — Kelola Data hub reorganization (ManageWorkers card prominent, stale cleanup) is now covered by v2.5 Phase 70. Remaining consolidation items (Proton Catalog, Assessment Management cards) stay in v2.3 scope if Phase 60/61 are executed.
**Original Requirements:** CONS-04 → partially replaced by USR-04

## v2.4 CDP Progress

### Phases

- [x] **Phase 63: Data Source Fix** — DATA-01, DATA-02, DATA-03, DATA-04 (completed 2026-02-27)
- [ ] **Phase 64: Functional Filters** — FILT-01, FILT-02, FILT-03, FILT-04, UI-01, UI-03
- [ ] **Phase 65: Actions** — ACTN-01, ACTN-02, ACTN-03, ACTN-04, ACTN-05
- [ ] **Phase 66: UI Polish** — UI-02, UI-04

### Phase Details

### Phase 63: Data Source Fix
**Goal:** Progress page queries ProtonDeliverableProgress + ProtonTrackAssignment (not IdpItems), displays real coachee list from CoachCoacheeMapping, and computes correct summary stats — the data foundation is accurate
**Depends on:** Phase 62 (v2.3 complete) — runs in parallel, independent of v2.3 progress
**Requirements:** DATA-01, DATA-02, DATA-03, DATA-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Progress page table rows come from ProtonDeliverableProgress joined with ProtonTrackAssignment — no IdpItems data appears
  2. Coach sees their real coachees in the dropdown, populated from CoachCoacheeMapping, not hardcoded mock values
  3. Summary stats (progress %, pending actions, pending approvals) match the actual ProtonDeliverableProgress records in the database
  4. Approving or updating evidence on the Deliverable page is immediately reflected on the Progress page with no stale cache
**Plans:** 2/2 plans complete

### Phase 64: Functional Filters
**Goal:** Every filter on the Progress page (Bagian/Unit, Coachee, Track, Tahun, Search) genuinely narrows the data returned — parameters are wired to queries and roles scope what users can see
**Depends on:** Phase 63
**Requirements:** FILT-01, FILT-02, FILT-03, FILT-04, UI-01, UI-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. HC/Admin selecting a Bagian or Unit filter receives only deliverable rows for workers in that Bagian/Unit
  2. Coach selecting a coachee from the dropdown sees only that coachee's deliverable rows — other coachees' data disappears
  3. Selecting Proton Track (Panelman/Operator) and/or Tahun (1/2/3) filters rows to matching assignments only
  4. Typing in the search box hides non-matching competency rows client-side without a page reload
  5. Role-scoped data is enforced: Spv sees their unit, SrSpv/SectionHead see their section, HC/Admin see all — not based on filter selection alone
  6. Filter dropdowns show the currently selected value as selected on page reload (no incorrect HTML selected attribute behavior)
**Plans:** TBD

### Phase 65: Actions
**Goal:** Approve, reject, coaching report, evidence, and export actions all persist to the database — no more console.log stubs or missing onclick handlers
**Depends on:** Phase 64
**Requirements:** ACTN-01, ACTN-02, ACTN-03, ACTN-04, ACTN-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. SrSpv or SectionHead clicking Approve on a deliverable row updates ProtonDeliverableProgress.Status to Approved in the database and the row reflects the new status on reload
  2. SrSpv or SectionHead clicking Reject opens a rejection reason input; submitting it saves the reason to ProtonDeliverableProgress and status becomes Rejected
  3. Coach submitting a coaching report modal creates a new CoachingSession record in the database with the entered details
  4. Clicking Upload Evidence on a deliverable row opens the existing Deliverable workflow (or inline upload); the file is saved and viewable from the Progress page
  5. Export Excel and Export PDF buttons generate and download the current filtered data as a file
**Plans:** TBD

### Phase 66: UI Polish
**Goal:** Progress page handles edge cases gracefully — empty states communicate clearly, and large datasets do not load all rows at once
**Depends on:** Phase 65
**Requirements:** UI-02, UI-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. When no deliverable data matches the current filter/role scope, the table shows a descriptive empty-state message instead of a blank table
  2. Large coachee/deliverable datasets are paginated so the page does not load hundreds of rows at once; user can navigate between pages
**Plans:** TBD

## v2.5 User Infrastructure & AD Readiness

  2. Old /CMP/ManageWorkers returns 301 redirect to /Admin/ManageWorkers
  3. Standalone "Kelola Pekerja" button removed from navbar — access only via Kelola Data hub
  4. Role-to-SelectedView mapping extracted to shared helper UserRoles.GetDefaultView()
**Plans:** 2 plans

- [ ] 69-02: Remove from CMPController, remove navbar button, verify all internal links

### Phase 70: Kelola Data Hub Reorganization
**Goal:** Admin/Index.cshtml restructured — ManageWorkers prominent, stale items cleaned up
**Depends on:** Phase 69
**Requirements:** USR-04
**Partially supersedes:** v2.3 Phase 62 (Update Kelola Data Hub)
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Kelola Data hub page (Admin/Index.cshtml) has ManageWorkers card in prominent position
  2. Stale "Segera" items cleaned up — cards for implemented features show active status
  3. Section C removed or reorganized
**Plans:** 1 plan
- [ ] 70-01: Rewrite Admin/Index.cshtml sections, add Kelola Pekerja card, remove Section C

### Phase 71: LDAP Auth Service Foundation
