<summary>✅ v1.1 CDP Coaching Management (Phases 4-8) — SHIPPED 2026-02-18</summary>

### Phase 4: Foundation & Coaching Sessions
**Goal:** Coaches can log sessions and action items against a stable data model, with users able to view their full coaching history
**Depends on:** Phase 3 (v1.0 complete)
**Requirements:** COACH-01, COACH-02, COACH-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Coach can create a coaching session with domain-specific fields (Kompetensi, SubKompetensi, Deliverable, CoacheeCompetencies, CatatanCoach, Kesimpulan, Result) for a coachee
  2. Coach can add action items with due dates to a coaching session
  3. User can view their coaching session history with date and status filtering
  4. All existing v1.0 features remain functional after schema migration (broken CoachingLog FK fixed)
**Plans:** 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 04-01-PLAN.md — Data foundation: models, DbContext, CoachingLog cleanup, migration
- [x] 04-02-PLAN.md — Controller actions and view: coaching CRUD with filtering
- [x] 04-03-PLAN.md — Gap closure: replace Topic/Notes with domain-specific coaching fields

#### Phase 5: Proton Deliverable Tracking
**Goal:** Coachee can track assigned deliverables in a structured Kompetensi hierarchy, with coaches able to upload and revise evidence files sequentially
**Depends on:** Phase 4
**Requirements:** PROTN-01, PROTN-02, PROTN-03, PROTN-04, PROTN-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Coach or SrSpv can assign a coachee to a Proton track (Panelman or Operator, Tahun 1/2/3) from the Proton Main page
  2. Coachee can view their full deliverable list on the IDP Plan page organized by Kompetensi > Sub Kompetensi > Deliverable (read-only, no status, no navigation links)
  3. Coachee can only access the next deliverable after the current one is approved — sequential lock is enforced
  4. Coach can upload evidence files for an active deliverable on the Deliverable page
  5. Coach can revise evidence and resubmit a rejected deliverable
**Plans:** 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 05-01-PLAN.md — Data foundation: Proton models, DbContext, migration, seed data
- [x] 05-02-PLAN.md — ProtonMain track assignment page and PlanIdp hybrid Coachee view
- [x] 05-03-PLAN.md — Deliverable page with sequential lock, evidence upload, and resubmit

#### Phase 6: Approval Workflow & Completion
**Goal:** Deliverables move through the SrSpv/SectionHead approval chain to completion, with HC completing final approvals before creating a final Proton Assessment that updates competency levels
**Depends on:** Phase 5
**Requirements:** APPRV-01, APPRV-02, APPRV-03, APPRV-04, APPRV-05, APPRV-06, PROTN-06, PROTN-07, PROTN-08
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Coach can submit a deliverable for approval
  2. SrSpv or SectionHead can approve or reject a submitted deliverable — either approver alone is sufficient for the coachee to proceed
  3. Approver can reject with a written reason; both coach and coachee can see rejection status and reason
  4. HC receives notification when a coachee completes all deliverables; HC approval is non-blocking per deliverable but HC must complete all pending approvals before creating a final Proton Assessment
  5. Coachee's Proton view shows final assessment status and resulting competency level update
**Plans:** 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 06-01-PLAN.md — Data foundation: extend models, add ProtonNotification/ProtonFinalAssessment, migration
- [x] 06-02-PLAN.md — Approve/Reject actions with rejection reasons and sequential unlock
- [x] 06-03-PLAN.md — HC workflow: HCApprovals queue, final assessment, PlanIdp completion card

</details>

### 🚧 v1.9 Proton Catalog Management (Phases 33-37)

**Milestone Goal:** HC/Admin can manage the full Proton program catalog (Tracks → Kompetensi → SubKompetensi → Deliverable) through a single web page with no database access needed — full CRUD, drag-and-drop reorder, and delete guards with active coachee impact counts.

---

#### Phase 33: ProtonTrack Schema
**Goal:** The ProtonTrack entity exists as a first-class table and ProtonKompetensi references it via FK — no code or data depends on the old TrackType+TahunKe strings anymore
**Depends on:** Phase 32 (v1.8 complete)
**Requirements:** SCHEMA-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. A `ProtonTrack` table exists in the database with TrackType, TahunKe, and DisplayName columns
  2. `ProtonKompetensi` rows each have a non-null `ProtonTrackId` FK pointing to a row in `ProtonTrack`
  3. All existing seeded Proton data (Panelman / Operator tracks, Tahun 1/2/3) is present and intact after migration
  4. The AssignTrack workflow resolves tracks by ProtonTrackId — no code reads TrackType+TahunKe strings from ProtonKompetensi directly
**Plans:** 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 33-01-PLAN.md — ProtonTrack model, DbContext registration, EF migration; data migration populating ProtonTrack rows from distinct TrackType+TahunKe values in existing ProtonKompetensi; add ProtonTrackId FK column and backfill; drop old string columns
- [x] 33-02-PLAN.md — Update SeedProtonData.cs to seed via ProtonTrack FKs; update AssignTrack and any other CDPController reads that filter by TrackType+TahunKe to use ProtonTrackId

---

#### Phase 34: Catalog Page
**Goal:** HC/Admin can open the Proton Catalog Manager from navigation and view the complete Kompetensi → SubKompetensi → Deliverable tree for any track, with expand/collapse per row and a working track dropdown
**Depends on:** Phase 33
**Requirements:** CAT-01, CAT-02, CAT-09
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. HC/Admin sees a "Proton Catalog" link in the navigation that takes them to the catalog manager page
  2. HC/Admin selects a track from the dropdown — the page shows all Kompetensi for that track as top-level rows
  3. HC/Admin expands a Kompetensi row — SubKompetensi rows appear beneath it; expanding a SubKompetensi row reveals its Deliverables
  4. HC/Admin submits the "Add Track" modal with TrackType, TahunKe, and DisplayName — the new track appears in the dropdown immediately without a full page reload
  5. Page is read-only in this phase (no add/edit/delete/reorder controls yet)
**Plans:** 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 34-01-PLAN.md — ProtonCatalogController with Index GET (load tracks, load catalog for selected track), GetCatalogTree GET (AJAX partial), AddTrack POST (JSON); ProtonCatalogViewModel appended to ProtonViewModels.cs
- [x] 34-02-PLAN.md — Views/ProtonCatalog/Index.cshtml (track dropdown, AJAX tree reload, Add Track modal + JS), Views/ProtonCatalog/_CatalogTree.cshtml (Bootstrap collapse tree partial), _Layout.cshtml CDP nav dropdown with Proton Catalog link (HC/Admin only)

---

#### Phase 35: CRUD Add and Edit
**Goal:** HC/Admin can add Kompetensi, SubKompetensi, and Deliverables inline and rename any item in-place — all without leaving the page
**Depends on:** Phase 34
**Requirements:** CAT-03, CAT-04, CAT-05, CAT-06
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. HC/Admin clicks "Add Kompetensi" for the selected track — an inline input appears; submitting it adds the new Kompetensi to the tree without a page reload
  2. HC/Admin clicks "Add SubKompetensi" under a Kompetensi row — an inline input appears in the expanded section; submitting adds the SubKompetensi under the correct parent
  3. HC/Admin clicks "Add Deliverable" under a SubKompetensi row — an inline input appears and submission adds the Deliverable under the correct parent
  4. HC/Admin clicks the name of any Kompetensi, SubKompetensi, or Deliverable — it becomes an editable field; saving commits the new name via AJAX and the row updates in-place
**Plans:** 2 plans

Plans:
- [ ] 35-01-PLAN.md — Backend: AddKompetensi, AddSubKompetensi, AddDeliverable POST actions (JSON, return new item id + name); EditCatalogItem POST action (accepts level + id + name, updates correct entity)
- [ ] 35-02-PLAN.md — Frontend: empty-state messages per level, inline Add input rows with Save/Cancel buttons, pencil-icon edit trigger (visible on expand), AJAX wiring for all four endpoints with antiforgery token; human verification checkpoint

---

#### Phase 36: Delete Guards
**Goal:** HC/Admin can delete any catalog item only after seeing how many active coachees are affected and explicitly confirming — deletion cascades to all child items
**Depends on:** Phase 35
**Requirements:** CAT-07
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. HC/Admin clicks "Delete" on a Kompetensi — a Bootstrap modal appears showing the name of the item and the count of active coachees who have progress on it or any child item
  2. HC/Admin types or clicks a hard confirmation in the modal — the item and all its SubKompetensi and Deliverables are deleted; the tree updates without a page reload
  3. When 0 coachees are affected, the modal still appears but states "No active coachees affected" — deletion still requires confirmation
  4. Delete is available on SubKompetensi and Deliverables with the same guard — each shows its own affected coachee count
  5. Cascade order is enforced: Deliverables deleted before SubKompetensi before Kompetensi (no FK constraint errors)
**Plans:** TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 36-01-PLAN.md — Backend: GetDeleteImpact GET action (returns affected coachee count for item + children); DeleteCatalogItem POST action with cascade delete in correct order (Deliverables → SubKompetensi → Kompetensi → Track)
- [ ] 36-02-PLAN.md — Frontend: delete button per row triggers AJAX impact fetch → populates Bootstrap modal with item name + count → hard confirm triggers delete AJAX → removes row from tree on success

---

#### Phase 37: Drag-and-Drop Reorder
**Goal:** HC/Admin can drag Kompetensi, SubKompetensi, or Deliverable rows to a new position within their level — the new order persists immediately
**Depends on:** Phase 36
**Requirements:** CAT-08
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. HC/Admin drags a Kompetensi row to a new position — on drop, the visual order updates and an AJAX call persists the new sort order; page reload confirms order is saved
  2. HC/Admin drags a SubKompetensi row within its Kompetensi — same behavior: visual update + AJAX persist
  3. HC/Admin drags a Deliverable row within its SubKompetensi — same behavior
  4. Reorder is constrained within the same parent — a Kompetensi cannot be dropped into a different track's section; a Deliverable cannot be dropped under a different SubKompetensi
**Plans:** TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 37-01-PLAN.md — Backend: ReorderKompetensi, ReorderSubKompetensi, ReorderDeliverable POST actions (accept ordered id array, update SortOrder/DisplayOrder on each entity, SaveChanges)
- [ ] 37-02-PLAN.md — Frontend: SortableJS via CDN (same pattern as Chart.js in _Layout.cshtml); initialize Sortable on each level's container; onEnd handler POSTs new id order array to correct reorder endpoint; drag handles styled with Bootstrap icons
