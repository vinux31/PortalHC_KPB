<summary>✅ v1.1 CDP Coaching Management (Phases 4-8) — SHIPPED 2026-02-18</summary>

### Phase 4: Foundation & Coaching Sessions
**Goal:** Coaches can log sessions and action items against a stable data model, with users able to view their full coaching history
**Depends on:** Phase 3 (v1.0 complete)
**Requirements:** COACH-01, COACH-02, COACH-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Coach can create a coaching session with domain-specific fields (Kompetensi, SubKompetensi, Deliverable, CoacheeCompetencies, CatatanCoach, Kesimpulan, Result) for a coachee
  2. Coach can add action items with due dates to a coaching session
  3. User can view their coaching session history with date and status filtering
  4. All existing v1.0 features remain functional after schema migration (broken CoachingLog FK fixed)
**Plans:** 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 04-01-PLAN.md — Data foundation: models, DbContext, CoachingLog cleanup, migration
- [x] 04-02-PLAN.md — Controller actions and view: coaching CRUD with filtering
- [x] 04-03-PLAN.md — Gap closure: replace Topic/Notes with domain-specific coaching fields

#### Phase 5: Proton Deliverable Tracking
**Goal:** Coachee can track assigned deliverables in a structured Kompetensi hierarchy, with coaches able to upload and revise evidence files sequentially
**Depends on:** Phase 4
**Requirements:** PROTN-01, PROTN-02, PROTN-03, PROTN-04, PROTN-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Coach or SrSpv can assign a coachee to a Proton track (Panelman or Operator, Tahun 1/2/3) from the Proton Main page
  2. Coachee can view their full deliverable list on the IDP Plan page organized by Kompetensi > Sub Kompetensi > Deliverable (read-only, no status, no navigation links)
  3. Coachee can only access the next deliverable after the current one is approved — sequential lock is enforced
  4. Coach can upload evidence files for an active deliverable on the Deliverable page
  5. Coach can revise evidence and resubmit a rejected deliverable
**Plans:** 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 05-01-PLAN.md — Data foundation: Proton models, DbContext, migration, seed data
- [x] 05-02-PLAN.md — ProtonMain track assignment page and PlanIdp hybrid Coachee view
- [x] 05-03-PLAN.md — Deliverable page with sequential lock, evidence upload, and resubmit

#### Phase 6: Approval Workflow & Completion
**Goal:** Deliverables move through the SrSpv/SectionHead approval chain to completion, with HC completing final approvals before creating a final Proton Assessment that updates competency levels
**Depends on:** Phase 5
**Requirements:** APPRV-01, APPRV-02, APPRV-03, APPRV-04, APPRV-05, APPRV-06, PROTN-06, PROTN-07, PROTN-08

  1. Coach can submit a deliverable for approval
  2. SrSpv or SectionHead can approve or reject a submitted deliverable — either approver alone is sufficient for the coachee to proceed
  3. Approver can reject with a written reason; both coach and coachee can see rejection status and reason
  4. HC receives notification when a coachee completes all deliverables; HC approval is non-blocking per deliverable but HC must complete all pending approvals before creating a final Proton Assessment
  5. Coachee's Proton view shows final assessment status and resulting competency level update
**Plans:** 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 06-01-PLAN.md — Data foundation: extend models, add ProtonNotification/ProtonFinalAssessment, migration

**Depends on:** Phase 7
**Plans:** 2 plans

Plans:

**Plans:** TBD

### Phase 61: Konsolidasi Assessment Management

## v2.4 CDP Progress

### Phases

- [x] **Phase 63: Data Source Fix** — DATA-01, DATA-02, DATA-03, DATA-04 (completed 2026-02-27)
- [ ] **Phase 64: Functional Filters** — FILT-01, FILT-02, FILT-03, FILT-04, UI-01, UI-03
- [ ] **Phase 65: Actions** — ACTN-01, ACTN-02, ACTN-03, ACTN-04, ACTN-05
- [ ] **Phase 66: UI Polish** — UI-02, UI-04

### Phase Details

### Phase 63: Data Source Fix
**Goal:** Progress page queries ProtonDeliverableProgress + ProtonTrackAssignment (not IdpItems), displays real coachee list from CoachCoacheeMapping, and computes correct summary stats — the data foundation is accurate
**Depends on:** Phase 62 (v2.3 complete) — runs in parallel, independent of v2.3 progress
**Requirements:** DATA-01, DATA-02, DATA-03, DATA-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Progress page table rows come from ProtonDeliverableProgress joined with ProtonTrackAssignment — no IdpItems data appears
  2. Coach sees their real coachees in the dropdown, populated from CoachCoacheeMapping, not hardcoded mock values
  3. Summary stats (progress %, pending actions, pending approvals) match the actual ProtonDeliverableProgress records in the database
  4. Approving or updating evidence on the Deliverable page is immediately reflected on the Progress page with no stale cache
**Plans:** 2/2 plans complete

### Phase 64: Functional Filters
**Goal:** Every filter on the Progress page (Bagian/Unit, Coachee, Track, Tahun, Search) genuinely narrows the data returned — parameters are wired to queries and roles scope what users can see
**Depends on:** Phase 63
**Requirements:** FILT-01, FILT-02, FILT-03, FILT-04, UI-01, UI-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. HC/Admin selecting a Bagian or Unit filter receives only deliverable rows for workers in that Bagian/Unit
  2. Coach selecting a coachee from the dropdown sees only that coachee's deliverable rows — other coachees' data disappears
  3. Selecting Proton Track (Panelman/Operator) and/or Tahun (1/2/3) filters rows to matching assignments only
  4. Typing in the search box hides non-matching competency rows client-side without a page reload
  5. Role-scoped data is enforced: Spv sees their unit, SrSpv/SectionHead see their section, HC/Admin see all — not based on filter selection alone
  6. Filter dropdowns show the currently selected value as selected on page reload (no incorrect HTML selected attribute behavior)
**Plans:** TBD

### Phase 65: Actions
**Goal:** Approve, reject, coaching report, evidence, and export actions all persist to the database — no more console.log stubs or missing onclick handlers
**Depends on:** Phase 64
**Requirements:** ACTN-01, ACTN-02, ACTN-03, ACTN-04, ACTN-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. SrSpv or SectionHead clicking Approve on a deliverable row updates ProtonDeliverableProgress.Status to Approved in the database and the row reflects the new status on reload
  2. SrSpv or SectionHead clicking Reject opens a rejection reason input; submitting it saves the reason to ProtonDeliverableProgress and status becomes Rejected
  3. Coach submitting a coaching report modal creates a new CoachingSession record in the database with the entered details
  4. Clicking Upload Evidence on a deliverable row opens the existing Deliverable workflow (or inline upload); the file is saved and viewable from the Progress page
  5. Export Excel and Export PDF buttons generate and download the current filtered data as a file
**Plans:** TBD

### Phase 66: UI Polish
**Goal:** Progress page handles edge cases gracefully — empty states communicate clearly, and large datasets do not load all rows at once
**Depends on:** Phase 65
**Requirements:** UI-02, UI-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. When no deliverable data matches the current filter/role scope, the table shows a descriptive empty-state message instead of a blank table
  2. Large coachee/deliverable datasets are paginated so the page does not load hundreds of rows at once; user can navigate between pages
**Plans:** TBD
