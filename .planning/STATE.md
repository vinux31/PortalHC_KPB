# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-21)

**Core value:** Evidence-based competency tracking with automated assessment-to-CPDP integration
**Current focus:** v1.8 Assessment Polish — Phases 27-30 ✅ complete, Phase 31 planned and ready to execute

## Current Position

**Milestone:** v1.8 Assessment Polish — IN PROGRESS
**Phase:** Phase 31: HC Reporting Actions — 🗺 PLANNED (0/2 plans executed)
**Next Phase:** Phase 31 — ready to execute (2 plans, 1 wave)
**Status:** Phase 31 fully planned. 31-01: ExportAssessmentResults GET action (ClosedXML, all workers, Name/NIP/Package/Status/Score/Result/CompletedAt). 31-02: ForceCloseAll POST action (Open/InProgress→Abandoned, AuditLogService summary entry, confirm() guard). Both plans Wave 1.
**Last activity:** 2026-02-23 — Phase 31 planned: research + planner + checker all passed. Ready for /gsd:execute-phase 31.

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░] 5% (v1.8) | v1.7 complete ✅

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

**v1.7 architecture notes:**
- CMPController is ~2300 lines — v1.7 adds Abandon, ForceClose, Reset, AuditLog actions; be mindful of file size
- PackageUserResponse table created (Phase 23-01 done) — migration 20260221030204_AddPackageUserResponse applied
- AuditLog table created (Phase 24-01 done) — migration 20260221032754_AddAuditLog applied; AuditLogService registered as scoped DI
- SessionStatus is a plain string — Phase 21 added InProgress; Phase 22 adds Abandoned (no DB constraint)
- StartedAt (Phase 21, done) and ExamWindowCloseDate (Phase 22) are nullable datetime2 columns
- Token enforcement moved server-side (Phase 23-03 done): StartExam GET checks TempData[TokenVerified_{id}] set by VerifyToken POST; direct URL bypass no longer possible
- Idempotency pattern established: use StartedAt == null as guard for first-write, not Status string comparison
- AbandonExam (22-02, done): StartedAt preserved on Abandon — HC audit requires it; Reset (22-04) clears it for retake
- AbandonExam (22-02, done): worker-only ownership check (assessment.UserId != user.Id), no role guard on this action
- Hidden form POST + confirm() + onbeforeunload bypass pattern established for exam destructive actions

**v1.6 decisions (Phase 20-01):**
- EditTrainingRecord has no GET action — modal is pre-populated inline via Razor in WorkerDetail.cshtml
- WorkerId and WorkerName stored on EditTrainingRecordViewModel for redirect without extra DB lookup
- Assessment Online rows excluded from Edit/Delete — guarded by RecordType == "Training Manual" && TrainingRecordId.HasValue
- [Phase 22-exam-lifecycle-actions]: LIFE-03: 2-minute grace period fixed (not configurable); expiry redirects to StartExam; no Status mutation; null-StartedAt sessions bypass check
- [Phase 22-04]: Abandoned branch placed before InProgress in UserStatus projection — Abandoned sessions have StartedAt set and would otherwise be misclassified as InProgress
- [Phase 22-04]: ResetAssessment deletes UserPackageAssignment so next StartExam assigns a fresh random package; ForceCloseAssessment preserves answers for audit
- [Phase 22-exam-lifecycle-actions]: ExamWindowCloseDate is nullable (null=no expiry); Abandoned guard placed alongside close-date guard before InProgress write; bulk-assign copies ExamWindowCloseDate from savedAssessment
- [Phase 23-03]: TempData keyed by assessment ID (TokenVerified_{id}) for scoped token verification; StartedAt==null guards first entry only; UserId==user.Id provides HC/Admin bypass
- [Phase 23]: PackageOptionId nullable int — null=skipped question, matching UserResponse.SelectedOptionId pattern; all PKR FKs use Restrict delete to avoid cascade cycles
- [Phase 23-02]: Results action branches on UserPackageAssignment presence — package path loads PackageUserResponse+PackageQuestion+PackageOption and uses shuffled order; TotalQuestions from orderedQuestionIds.Count (not Questions.Count which is 0 for package sessions)
- [Phase 24-01]: AuditLogService calls SaveChangesAsync internally — audit rows written immediately; actor name stored as "NIP - FullName" at write time for permanence; audit calls placed AFTER primary SaveChangesAsync (no phantom rows); delete actions wrap audit in try/catch to avoid rolling back successful deletes
- [Phase 24-02]: pageSize fixed at 25 (KISS); page clamping for safe URL manipulation; Audit Log button btn-outline-secondary to distinguish from create/nav actions; nav link in existing canManage guard — no duplicate role check needed
- [Phase 25-01]: Riwayat Ujian query in worker branch only; direct C# var/if statements at top-level Razor else-block (no @{} needed); @* *@ Razor comments for C# context
- [Phase 25-02]: viewModel declared outside if/else branches in Results action to enable shared competency lookup block after both package and legacy paths
- [Phase 25-02]: CompetencyGains only populated when IsPassed=true — failed assessments never show competency section; double null guard in view handles both null and empty cases
- [Phase 26-01]: DeletePackage cascade: PackageUserResponses (via questionIds) → UserPackageAssignments → Options → Questions → Package; assignment count pre-computed in ManagePackages GET via GroupBy into ViewBag.AssignmentCounts; @{} block inside foreach pre-computes confirm message to avoid Razor @ collision in onsubmit
- [Phase 26-02]: Client-side JS confirm() guard for schedule-change warning — no server-side confirm page needed; IIFE fires before Bootstrap validation; OriginalSchedule as yyyy-MM-dd string for direct === comparison

**v1.8 architecture notes:**
- GetMonitorData (AJAX endpoint) now uses 4-state UserStatus matching AssessmentMonitoringDetail: Completed / Abandoned / In Progress / Not started (Phase 27-01 done); Abandoned branch placed before InProgress because Abandoned sessions have StartedAt set
- Phase 28 re-assign/reshuffle must guard against overwriting Completed sessions
- Phase 29 auto-transition: COMPLETE — time-based WIB comparison `Schedule <= DateTime.UtcNow.AddHours(7)` at all 3 sites (GetMonitorData display-only, worker list display-only, StartExam persisted); StartExam time gate blocks future-scheduled access (Status=="Upcoming" → redirect with "Ujian belum dibuka"); Schedule time picker on Create/Edit forms (ScheduleDate + ScheduleTime combined into hidden ScheduleHidden via JS before submit, default 08:00); Assessment.cshtml Upcoming cards show "Opens DD MMM YYYY, HH:mm WIB"
- Phase 31 RPT-02 ForceCloseAll is additive to existing per-session ForceClose (Phase 22) — reuse same status transition and audit log pattern
- [Phase 32-01]: Legacy exam paths (StartExam, ExamSummary, SubmitExam) now use sibling session lookup identical to package path (Title + Category + Schedule.Date); StartExam reuses siblingSessionIds already computed for package check; ExamSummary and SubmitExam compute it inline in their else-blocks; UserResponse.AssessmentSessionId = id (worker's own session) unchanged
- [Phase 28-01]: ReshufflePackage selects different package only when 2+ packages exist AND current assignment exists
- [Phase 28-01]: ReshuffleAll uses batch SaveChangesAsync (once after all worker changes) with audit in try/catch
- [Phase 28-02]: reshuffleAll(event) receives event from onclick attribute — simpler than querySelector
- [Phase 28-02]: Hidden form antiforgery pattern for AJAX token extraction — more reliable than regex parsing
- [Phase 29-03]: ScheduleDate+ScheduleTime plain inputs (no asp-for); ScheduleHidden carries asp-for binding populated by JS before submit
- [Phase 29-03]: Upcoming worker card disabled button shows exact opening datetime (HH:mm WIB) instead of day-countdown arithmetic
- [Phase 30-01]: Import deduplication: NormalizeText (trim+collapse whitespace+toLowerInvariant, no punctuation strip) + MakeFingerprint (join with ||| separator) + HashSet<string> existingFingerprints (per-package) + seenInBatch (in-batch self-dedup); silent skip with skipped counter (no errors entry); 0-valid-rows branch before all-duplicates branch in TempData routing; ThenInclude(q => q.Options) required on POST query; options sorted by Id asc for stable fingerprint
