# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-26)

**Core value:** Evidence-based competency tracking with automated assessment-to-CPDP integration
**Current focus:** v2.3 — Admin Portal

## Current Position

**Milestone:** v2.3 Admin Portal — In Progress
**Phase:** Phase 69 — ManageWorkers Migration to Admin (Complete — 2/2 plans done)
**Status:** Milestone complete
**Last activity:** 2026-02-28 - Completed Plan 69-02: CMPController ManageWorkers cleanup (11 actions removed), 5 CMP view files deleted, navbar Kelola Pekerja button removed, Manajemen Pekerja hub card added as first in Section A, zero stale references verified

Progress: [████████░░░░░░░░░░░░] 42% (v2.3 — 6/12 phases complete, v2.4 — 2/8 phases complete)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity (v1.0–v2.2):**
- Total milestones shipped: 14 (v1.0 through v2.2)
- Total phases: 46
- Timeline: 2026-02-14 → 2026-02-26 (12 days)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

**Phase 46-01 decisions:**
- Archival block placed BEFORE UserResponse deletion so session field values are still intact
- Archive and session reset share one existing SaveChangesAsync — no separate transaction call
- AttemptNumber computed as count of existing rows for (UserId, Title) + 1
- DeleteBehavior.Cascade on UserId FK so history rows clean up if user is deleted
- EF migrations require `--configuration Release` while the app is running (Debug exe is locked)

**Phase 46-02 decisions:**
- GetAllWorkersHistory() returns tuple (assessment, training) — two lists have different sort orders and columns
- Current session Attempt # = archived count for (UserId, Title) + 1, consistent with Plan 01 archival logic
- Batch GroupBy/ToDictionary for archived counts avoids N+1 query per session row
- Riwayat Assessment is default active sub-tab (show active) as it's the main new HIST-02/HIST-03 feature
- [Phase 47-01]: AdminController uses class-level [Authorize(Roles='Admin')] — all 12+ admin tool actions inherit auth without per-action decorators
- [Phase 47-01]: KkjMatrix view includes AntiForgeryToken + placeholder divs (editTable, editActions) for Plan 02 to inject without modifying the view

**Phase 47-02 decisions:**
- JS sends PascalCase property names matching C# model — avoids touching Program.cs (no PropertyNameCaseInsensitive config needed)
- editActions buttons placed in header toolbar div alongside btnEdit, using d-none/d-flex toggling
- deleteRow removes row from DOM and filters kkjItems array to keep JS state in sync without page reload
- EF upsert via FindAsync then update each property individually — avoids tracking conflicts with deserialized JSON objects
- [Phase 47-03]: KkjBagian seeded on first GET rather than migration data seed; Bagian stored as string name (FK by name) consistent with CpdpItem.Section precedent; per-bagian add-row buttons replace single global btnAddRow
- [Phase 47-04]: Read-mode Target_* column headers use bagian.Label_* values; inline delete for Id=0 rows is DOM-only (no server call); insert-below copies bagian name from current row's hidden Bagian input; Aksi th appended after 15 label inputs in renderEditRows() thead
- [Phase 48-01]: data-name attribute uses Razor auto-encoding (@item.NamaKompetensi) instead of Html.AttributeEncode which is unavailable in typed Razor views
- [Phase 48-02]: Razor auto-encoding (@item.Property) replaces Html.AttributeEncode — unavailable on IHtmlHelper<List<T>> typed views
- [Phase 48-02]: filterTables() queries both read and edit tbody rows so section filter persists across mode toggle
- [Phase 48-02]: MappingSectionSelect: dropdown replaces card layout; Lihat button disabled until section selected

**Phase 48-03 decisions:**
- ClosedXML already present at v0.105.0 — no package installation needed
- getTableCells() returns 2D array of first 6 td elements per row (data columns 0-5, excluding Aksi col at index 6)
- Export href updated in sectionFilter change handler (same listener as filterTables) — no separate event listener needed
- Build MSB3021/MSB3027 file-lock errors are running-process artifacts (not C# compilation errors)
- [Phase 48-04]: Read-mode table mirrors edit-mode: 3 missing columns (DetailIndikator, Silabus, TargetDeliverable) added to thead and tbody
- [Phase 48-04]: CpdpItemDelete reference guard removed: HC Admin has full delete authority regardless of IdpItem string references
- [Phase 48-04]: Backspace added alongside Delete for multi-cell clear: fixed (A || B) && C operator precedence, removed redundant nested if

**Phase 49-03 decisions:**
- View Results links remain pointing to CMP/Results since Results page stays in CMP controller
- Reshuffle AJAX URLs updated to /Admin/ReshufflePackage and /Admin/ReshuffleAll for future migration consistency
- CloseEarly form action points to Admin/CloseEarly (string-based asp-action compiles even without action existing yet)
- Added `using ClosedXML.Excel;` import to AdminController for cleaner Excel export code

**Phase 49-04 decisions:**
- CloseEarly, ReshufflePackage, ReshuffleAll added to AdminController (not in original plan) because Admin views from Plan 03 reference /Admin/CloseEarly, /Admin/ReshufflePackage, /Admin/ReshuffleAll
- IMemoryCache injected into AdminController constructor for CloseEarly cache invalidation
- BuildCrossPackageAssignment + Shuffle helper methods duplicated in AdminController (same approach as GenerateSecureToken from Plan 02)
- GetMonitorData endpoint kept in CMPController (not in removal list, still used indirectly)
- [Phase 49-05]: JSON island pattern (script type=application/json) used for success modal data to avoid quote conflicts in JS string literals
- [Phase 49-05]: AssessmentMonitoringDetail, ExportAssessmentResults, ForceCloseAll, CloseEarly now accept composite key (title, category, scheduleDate) — resilient to deleted representative sessions

**Phase 50-01 decisions:**
- Sequential loop counter (idx++) used for Bootstrap collapse HTML IDs — GUID hyphens break CSS selectors
- AllUsers loaded once as anonymous projection to avoid N+1 queries; grouping/pagination done in memory
- EligibleCoachees excludes users with active mappings (1 coach per coachee constraint)
- Modal submit stubs use console.log with "Wired in Plan 02" comment — write endpoints deferred to Plan 02
- Razor auto-encoding (@item.Property) used in data attributes — consistent with Phase 48 precedent

**Phase 50-02 decisions:**
- CoachAssignRequest and CoachEditRequest DTOs placed at namespace level (outside class, inside namespace)
- Deactivate does NOT touch ProtonTrackAssignment — track stays when coaching relationship ends (per plan spec)
- Simple int id params (Deactivate/Reactivate/GetSessionCount) use form-urlencoded; complex objects use [FromBody] JSON
- Export uses MemoryStream with ToArray() — stream disposed after SaveAs, bytes already in memory
- deactivateTargetId stored as JS var — avoids hidden input race conditions when modal fires multiple times
- [Phase 51-01]: Razor selected/disabled uses '? value : null' pattern to avoid RZ1031 tag helper error
- [Phase 51-01]: EF migration cleanup SQL ordered to respect FK dependencies: progresses -> deliverables -> sub-kompetensi -> kompetensi
- [Phase 51-01]: CoachingGuidanceFile FK to ProtonTrack uses DeleteBehavior.Restrict; Proton Track Assignment card removed from Admin/Index Section B (absorbed by Phase 50)
- [Phase 51]: SilabusRowDto/SilabusDeleteRequest DTOs at namespace level; SilabusSave flushes SaveChangesAsync per hierarchy level for EF-generated FK IDs; silabusFilter JSON island pattern for passing Razor state to IIFE JS; deleteTargetIndex in IIFE closure to avoid stale modal data
- [Phase 51-03]: GuidanceDelete uses [FromBody] GuidanceDeleteRequest JSON DTO; upload files named {timestamp}_{GUID}{ext} with original filename stored in DB; GuidanceReplace deletes old physical file then saves new one in-place; ProtonCatalogController stripped to redirect-only with no DI constructor
- [Phase 52-02]: Deliverable() allProgresses+orderedProgresses load removed entirely: isAccessible=true unconditionally eliminates unnecessary DB query
- [Phase 52-02]: ApproveDeliverable() orderedProgresses load retained: still needed for allApproved check and HC notification trigger
- [Phase 52-02]: EF migration Down() left empty: cannot reverse data migration that deleted Locked status semantics
- [Phase 52-01]: statusFilter applied in-memory after loading full scope data — small dataset per unit (10-30 coachees), no performance issue
- [Phase 52-01]: Badge click uses AJAX OverrideDetail endpoint rather than pre-loading all record data — avoids large data island

**Phase 67-01 decisions:**
- string.IsNullOrEmpty() used for ALL fields — FullName defaults to string.Empty (never null but may be empty), so ?? alone would NOT catch it
- Role display: userRole variable with special case — if "No Role", show em dash (consistent with controller fallback behavior)
- Profile header subtitle shows Position with italic muted fallback text (not em dash) to visually distinguish header area from field rows
- No cards per CONTEXT locked decisions — flat col-md-8 container with border-bottom header divider and hr between sections
- [Phase 68-01]: [Phase 68-01]: SettingsViewModel composite GET model, [Bind(Prefix)] POST actions, section-specific TempData keys, RefreshSignInAsync after ChangePasswordAsync
- [Phase 68-02]: Section-specific TempData alerts placed ABOVE their respective form section headings for adjacency with submitted form
- [Phase 68-02]: Read-only admin-managed fields use disabled HTML inputs with 'Dikelola oleh admin' hint text for consistent form layout
- [Phase 68-02]: Native confirm() dialog on password submit — onclick='return confirm()' requires zero JS setup
- [Phase 69-01]: Changed AdminController class-level [Authorize(Roles='Admin')] to [Authorize] + per-action [Authorize(Roles='Admin')] on all existing actions + [Authorize(Roles='Admin,HC')] on ManageWorkers actions and Index()
- [Phase 69-01]: GetDefaultView() extracted to UserRoles.cs using existing role constants — replaces 3 duplicated inline switch statements in CreateWorker/EditWorker/ImportWorkers POST actions
- [Phase 69-02]: Clean break migration — /CMP/ManageWorkers returns 404, no redirects; Manajemen Pekerja hub card first in Section A; training records WorkerDetail preserved at CMPController
