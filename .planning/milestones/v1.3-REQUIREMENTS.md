**Archived:** 2026-02-19
**Status:** SHIPPED

## v1.3 Requirements — Final Status

### Navigation (NAV)

- [x] **NAV-01**: HC/Admin sees a dedicated "Manage Assessments" card on CMP Index (workers do not see it) — ✅ Shipped Phase 13
- [x] **NAV-02**: CMP Index "Manage Assessments" card links directly to manage view (`/CMP/Assessment?view=manage`) — ✅ Shipped Phase 13
- [x] **NAV-03**: Embedded Create Assessment form removed from CMP Index (revert) — ✅ Shipped Phase 13

### Assessment Creation (CRT)

- [x] **CRT-01**: "Create Assessment" green button on manage view links to dedicated `/CMP/CreateAssessment` page — ✅ Shipped Phase 13
- [x] **CRT-02**: After successful creation, HC is redirected back to manage view (not CMP Index) — ✅ Shipped Phase 13

### Bulk Assign (BLK)

- [x] **BLK-01**: Edit Assessment form includes a section to add more users to an existing assessment — ✅ Shipped Phase 14
- [x] **BLK-02**: Edit Assessment form shows currently assigned users alongside a picker for selecting additional ones; saving creates new AssessmentSessions with the same settings — ✅ Shipped Phase 14

### Quick Edit (QED)

- [ ] **QED-01**: HC can change an assessment's status directly from the manage view card (no full Edit page needed) — ❌ Cancelled — Phase 15 reverted; Edit page is sufficient
- [ ] **QED-02**: HC can reschedule an assessment directly from the manage view card — ❌ Cancelled — Phase 15 reverted; Edit page is sufficient

## Outcome Summary

| Requirement | Phase | Final Status |
|-------------|-------|--------------|
| NAV-01 | Phase 13 | ✅ Shipped |
| NAV-02 | Phase 13 | ✅ Shipped |
| NAV-03 | Phase 13 | ✅ Shipped |
| CRT-01 | Phase 13 | ✅ Shipped |
| CRT-02 | Phase 13 | ✅ Shipped |
| BLK-01 | Phase 14 | ✅ Shipped |
| BLK-02 | Phase 14 | ✅ Shipped |
| QED-01 | Phase 15 | ❌ Cancelled |
| QED-02 | Phase 15 | ❌ Cancelled |

**7/9 requirements shipped.** QED-01 and QED-02 (Quick Edit) were explicitly cancelled — the Edit Assessment page covers the same need with less surface area.

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Bulk delete assessments | High risk, not requested |
| Assessment templates | Future milestone |
| Notification on new assignment | Notifications feature not yet built |
