## v2.0 Requirements

### Assessment Management (ASSESS)

- ✅ **ASSESS-01**: HC can close an active assessment group early from AssessmentMonitoringDetail — clicking "Tutup Lebih Awal" sets ExamWindowCloseDate to now, Open sessions are blocked from starting, and InProgress sessions are force-completed with score calculated from their actual submitted answers (not Score=0) — v2.0 (Phase 39)
- ✅ **ASSESS-02**: The Monitoring tab automatically hides assessment groups 7 days after their ExamWindowCloseDate (falls back to Schedule date if ExamWindowCloseDate is null) — v2.0 (Phase 38)
- ✅ **ASSESS-03**: The Management tab applies the same 7-day auto-hide filter as ASSESS-02 — assessment groups disappear from Management tab 7 days after close — v2.0 (Phase 38)

### Training History (HIST)

- ✅ **HIST-01**: The RecordsWorkerList page has a second "History" tab showing all workers' manual training records and assessment online completions combined in a single table, sorted by tanggal mulai descending — v2.0 (Phase 40)
