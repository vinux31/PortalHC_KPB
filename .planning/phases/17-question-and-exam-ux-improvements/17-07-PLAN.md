<objective>
Human verification of the full Phase 17 exam flow from HC package management through worker exam-taking and results.

Purpose: The paged exam is a complex interactive experience — timer, page switching, answer tracking, collapsible panel, and summary all need visual confirmation.
Output: Verified exam flow or list of issues to fix.

  <name>Task 1: Verify full Phase 17 exam flow end-to-end</name>
  <action>All plans 01-06 are complete. Run the verification steps below to confirm the full HC package management and worker exam flow works correctly.</action>
  <what-built>
Complete Phase 17 Question and Exam UX system:
1. Test package data model (AssessmentPackage, PackageQuestion, PackageOption, UserPackageAssignment)
2. HC: Manage Packages page (create/delete packages per assessment)
3. HC: Import questions via Excel file upload or paste (ClosedXML parser)
4. Paged exam view (10 questions/page, Prev/Next, timer with red warning at 5 min, collapsible Q-number panel, answered progress counter in header)
5. Pre-submit summary page (all answers listed, unanswered warning, final Submit button)
6. ID-based grading (grading uses PackageOption.Id, not displayed letters)
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
**HC workflow (as Admin or HC role):**
1. Go to /CMP/Assessment?view=manage
2. Click "Packages" button on any assessment group card
3. Create 1-2 packages (e.g., "Paket A", "Paket B")
4. Click "Import Questions" for Paket A
5. Upload a .xlsx with at least 12 rows (Question|OptA|OptB|OptC|OptD|Correct) — header row plus 12 question rows
6. Confirm success message shows correct question count
7. Try the Paste tab: paste 3-5 rows and import — confirm they are added
8. Try importing a row with invalid "Correct" column (e.g., "E") — confirm warning shown, valid rows still imported

**Worker exam flow (as a Worker/Coachee role assigned to the assessment):**
9. Go to /CMP/Assessment and open an assessment with packages
10. Start the exam — confirm first page shows exactly 10 questions (or fewer if package has fewer)
11. Confirm header shows "0/N answered" and timer counting down
12. Select answers on page 1; confirm answered count updates and panel shows green badges for answered
13. Click Next Page — confirms page 2 loads (if the package has 12 questions, page 2 should show 2)
14. Click Previous Page — confirms page 1 re-appears
15. Toggle the collapsible panel button — panel shows/hides
16. On the last page, click "Review and Submit"
17. Confirm ExamSummary page shows all questions with selected answers; unanswered questions highlighted
18. Click Submit — confirm Results page loads with a calculated score (not 0%)
19. Confirm pass/fail status correct based on configured PassPercentage
