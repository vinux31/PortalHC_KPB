<current_state>
Phase 49 (Assessment Management Migration) is fully planned. 4 plans ready across 3 waves. Not yet executed.
Worktrees are synced: main = terminal-a = origin/main = d88fea5.
</current_state>

<completed_work>

- Phase 48 gap closure executed + verified + pushed (4/4 plans complete)
- Phase 47 confirmed fully complete: 9/9 plans all have SUMMARY files, VERIFICATION passed (ROADMAP display is stale — shows [~] but actually done)
- Phase 49 planning complete: 4 plans in 3 waves, gsd-plan-checker approved
- Worktree sync × 2: resolved ROADMAP.md conflicts, synced main ↔ terminal-a
- Documented 2-terminal workflow solution (see <context>)
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

- Fix ROADMAP.md: Phase 47 should be [x] complete, not [~] in-progress
- Execute Phase 49: /gsd:execute-phase 49
  - Wave 1: Plan 49-01 (ManageAssessment GET + view + Admin/Index card)
  - Wave 2: Plans 49-02 + 49-03 in parallel (CRUD + Monitoring/Export)
  - Wave 3: Plan 49-04 (AuditLog migration + CMPController cleanup + CMP view)
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- [Phase 48-04] 3 UAT defects closed: 6-column read-mode table, delete guard removed, (A||B)&&C precedence fix
- [Phase 49] MDAT-03 removed from plans — Assessment Competency Map feature NOT needed
- [Phase 49] 1:1 migration: copy actions verbatim from CMPController to AdminController, adapt redirects only
- [Phase 49] AuditLog scope global; CMP/Assessment pure personal view (remove viewMode, canManage)
- [2-terminal workflow] terminal-a NEVER commits ROADMAP.md / STATE.md / REQUIREMENTS.md
- [2-terminal workflow] main pulls plan files via: git checkout origin/worktree/terminal-a -- .planning/phases/N+1-*/
- [git alias] terminal-a has alias "plan-commit" that auto-restores shared files before staging
</decisions_made>

<blockers>

None.

## 2-Terminal Workflow (important for next session)

terminal-a = discuss + plan phase N+1
main = execute phase N

**terminal-a commit rule (3 files NEVER commit):**
- .planning/ROADMAP.md
- .planning/STATE.md
- .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md

**terminal-a commit (safe):**
```bash
git restore .planning/ROADMAP.md .planning/STATE.md .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md
git add .planning/phases/50-*/
git commit -m "plan(50): ..."
git push origin worktree/terminal-a
```

**main: import plan from terminal-a:**
```bash
git fetch origin
git checkout origin/worktree/terminal-a -- .planning/phases/50-phase-name/
git add .planning/phases/50-phase-name/
git commit -m "sync(50): import phase plans from terminal-a"
```

**After sync — reset terminal-a:**
```bash
cd .claude/worktrees/terminal-a && git reset --hard origin/main
```

## Phase Status (verified 2026-02-26)
- Phase 47: ACTUALLY COMPLETE (9/9 summaries, verification passed) — ROADMAP display stale
- Phase 48: COMPLETE (4/4 plans, verified)
- Phase 49: PLANNED, not executed (4 plans ready)
</context>

<next_action>
1. Fix ROADMAP.md Phase 47 from [~] to [x] complete
2. /gsd:execute-phase 49
(Run /clear first for fresh context window)
</next_action>
