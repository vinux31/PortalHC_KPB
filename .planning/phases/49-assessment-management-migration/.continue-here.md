<completed_work>

**Session 2026-02-26:**
- Phase 48-04 gap closure executed: 3 UAT defects fixed (read-mode 6-column table, CpdpItemDelete reference guard removed, Delete/Backspace operator precedence fix)
- Phase 48 verified (status: passed) and marked complete in ROADMAP + STATE
- Worktree sync: rebased worktree/terminal-a onto main (resolved ROADMAP.md conflicts), fast-forward merged back to main, pushed to origin
- Phase 49 plans already exist (created in terminal-a, now in main): 49-01 through 49-04
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

- Phase 49: Assessment Management Migration — 4 plans, 0/4 complete
  - 49-01: AdminController ManageAssessment GET + ManageAssessment.cshtml + Admin/Index card update
  - 49-02: Create/Edit/Delete/RegenerateToken actions + CreateAssessment.cshtml + EditAssessment.cshtml
  - 49-03: Monitoring, Reset, ForceClose, Export, UserHistory actions + view files
  - 49-04: AuditLog migration + CMPController cleanup + CMP/Assessment personal-only + CMP/Index card updates
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- [Phase 48-04] Read-mode table mirrors edit-mode: 3 missing columns added (DetailIndikator, Silabus, TargetDeliverable)
- [Phase 48-04] CpdpItemDelete reference guard removed — HC Admin has full delete authority
- [Phase 48-04] (A || B) && C operator precedence fix for Delete/Backspace, nested if removed
- [Worktree sync] ROADMAP conflict resolved: kept main's Phase 48 completion status, kept worktree's Phase 49 "Assessment Management Migration" name (correct) and plan count (0/4)
- Phase 49 plans use name "Assessment Management Migration" (not "Assessment Competency Map Manager" which was stale in old ROADMAP)
</decisions_made>

<context>
v2.3 Admin Portal milestone. 1/12 phases complete (Phase 48). Phase 49 goal: migrate Manage Assessment functionality from CMPController to AdminController, create dedicated /Admin/ManageAssessment page, move AuditLog to admin, clean up CMP to be pure personal view.

The 4 plans are well-structured across 3 waves:
- Wave 1: Plans 01+02 in parallel (read/create/edit)
- Wave 2: Plan 03 (monitoring/reset/export)
- Wave 3: Plan 04 (AuditLog + CMP cleanup)

Phase 49 research and context files already exist at .planning/phases/49-assessment-management-migration/.
