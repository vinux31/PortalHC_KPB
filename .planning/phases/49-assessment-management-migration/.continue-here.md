<current_state>
Phase 49 (Assessment Management Migration) is fully planned and verified. 4 plans created in 3 waves, all committed and pushed. No execution has started yet — next step is /gsd:execute-phase 49.
</current_state>

<completed_work>

- Context gathered (49-CONTEXT.md) — discuss-phase done in prior session
- Research completed (49-RESEARCH.md) — gsd-phase-researcher produced 695-line research
- Planning completed — 4 plans created by gsd-planner:
  - 49-01: Admin ManageAssessment page scaffold (Wave 1)
  - 49-02: Create/Edit/Delete/RegenerateToken (Wave 2)
  - 49-03: Monitoring/Reset/ForceClose/Export/History (Wave 2)
  - 49-04: AuditLog migration + CMPController cleanup + CMP view updates (Wave 3)
- Verification passed (iteration 2/3) — gsd-plan-checker approved after revision
- Revision fixes applied: MDAT-03 removed from requirements (not applicable), .claire→.claude path typo fixed
- All committed and pushed to worktree/terminal-a
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

- Execute Phase 49: /gsd:execute-phase 49 (all 12 tasks across 4 plans)
  - Wave 1: Plan 49-01 (3 tasks — ManageAssessment GET, view, Admin/Index card)
  - Wave 2: Plans 49-02 + 49-03 in parallel (6 tasks — CRUD + Monitoring/Export)
  - Wave 3: Plan 49-04 (3 tasks — AuditLog, CMPController cleanup, CMP view cleanup)
- Merge worktree/terminal-a into main after execution
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- MDAT-03 requirement removed from all plans — CONTEXT.md explicitly states Assessment Competency Map feature is NOT needed (removed from roadmap). Phase 49 is Assessment Management Migration, not Assessment Competency Map Manager.
- 1:1 migration approach — copy all actions verbatim from CMPController to AdminController, only change redirects and controller references
- Kelola Data style — breadcrumb pattern: Admin > Kelola Data > Manage Assessments, consistent with KKJ Matrix (Phase 47)
- AuditLog scope stays global (show all actions, not filtered)
- CMP/Assessment becomes pure personal view — remove viewMode, canManage, manage toggle entirely
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
None — plans verified and ready for execution.
</blockers>

<context>
This is a refactoring/migration phase — moving existing manage assessment functionality from CMP to Admin. No new features, no new models, no test infrastructure. All 14 actions (ManageAssessment, CreateAssessment, EditAssessment, DeleteAssessment, DeleteAssessmentGroup, ResetAssessment, ForceCloseAssessment, ForceCloseAll, ExportAssessmentResults, AssessmentMonitoringDetail, GetMonitoringProgress, RegenerateToken, UserAssessmentHistory, AuditLog) are being migrated. The executor should copy code verbatim from CMPController and adapt redirects/routes only.

<next_action>
Start with: /gsd:execute-phase 49
Run /clear first for fresh context window.
